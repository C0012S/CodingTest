    Example 1:
        Input:
            Person table:
                +----+------------------+
                | id | email            |
                +----+------------------+
                | 1  | john@example.com |
                | 2  | bob@example.com  |
                | 3  | john@example.com |
                +----+------------------+

            Output:
                +----+------------------+
                | id | email            |
                +----+------------------+
                | 1  | john@example.com |
                | 2  | bob@example.com  |
                +----+------------------+

            Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
